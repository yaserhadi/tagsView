# Tags View Demo

This project shows a simple page with a left menu and a tag bar that tracks
visited menu items. Selecting a menu link adds a tag to the bar. Clicking a tag
or its close icon allows switching between or removing visited pages.

## How to open

No build step is required. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser or serve
the repository with any static file server.
