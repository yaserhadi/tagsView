# Tags View Demo

This project shows a simple page with a left menu and a tag bar that tracks
visited menu items. Selecting a menu link adds a tag to the bar. Clicking a tag
or its close icon allows switching between or removing visited pages.

Right-click any tag to change its font color, background color, or to close all
tags at once.

When the tag bar overflows horizontally, use the arrow buttons on the sides to
scroll left or right.

## How to open

No build step is required. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser or serve
the repository with any static file server.
